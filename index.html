					<p>I've had a lot of interesting jobs in my life. Starting out with Northrop Aircraft as an aerospace structures engineer in the 1980's gave me the opportunity to work on several state of the art aircraft programs including the F-20, B2, YF-23, and F-18. Each of these aircraft had their own unique set of challenges and allowed me the priviledge of working with some of the best engineers in the business. It was a time of change in the aircraft analysis community as many new CAD technologies were just starting to be implemented. </p>
					<br>
					<p>After a successful run at at Northrop, I moved to Raytheon where I spent many years analyzing electronic equipment for random vibration loading. At Raytheon I moved into management where I ran a multi-disciplinary analysis group which at times reached 35 people. Finally, I returned to Northrop (now Northrop Grumman) where I had the opportunity to work on the James Webb Space Telescope and recently got back to my aircraft roots, working on the trainer-X program. It's been really interesting and I'm looking forward to many more challenges and opportunities.</p>
